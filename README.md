## Purpose of this app?
*This app aimed to deliver timely updates of SmartPack-Kernel to its users.*

## Pre-requiremnts
1. Root access
2. TWRP

## How to use
1. Download and install the latest app version.
2. Go to app settings and give permission to access “*Storage*” (necessary to download Kernel zip files).
3. Open the app and allow "*root*" permissions.
4. The app will now prompt you to select “*ROM Base*” (AOSP/TW) and “*API*” (android versions *6.0.1*/*7.1.2*). You may change both of them in the “*Settings*” menu later.
5. Tick “*Experimental builds*” in the “*Settings*” to receive test builds (if you wish)
6. Swipe to refresh and wait till the new releases (if any) appears in your app screen (otherwise wait for the notification).
7. Click “*Change-logs*” to see the changes in a new version.
8. Click “*Download*” and follow the on screen instructions to flash the new Kernel.
9. Enjoy your new Kernel.

## Known issues
1. The app will still shows notifications about the available kernel versions even after they are installed. As a temporary workaround, you may mute the notification of this app from the status-bar, though it will force you to manually check for updates every time.
2. The auto flashing will not give an option to wipe cache after flashing kernel (though it is not at all necessary for flashing a kernel).
