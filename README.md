## How to use
1. Download and install the latest app version.

3. Open the app and allow "*root*" permissions.
4. Tick “*Experimental builds*” in the Settings to receive test builds (only if you wish)
5. Swipe to refresh and wait till the new releases (if any) appears in your app screen (otherwise wait for the notification).

## Known Issues
1. The app will still shows notifications about the available kernel versions even after it is already installed. As a temporary workaround, you may mute the notification of this app from the status-bar, though it will force you to manually check for updates every time.
2. The auto flashing will not give an option to wipe cache after flashing kernel (though it is not at all necessary for flashing a kernel).
